					 you will be required to provide certain information as part of the registration process.
					</p>
				<p>This information may include your first and last name, email address, telephone number and business or home address. 
					Membership information is used to communicate with you, to design content and activities that we believe would be of interest to you,

				<p>If you wish to opt-out of receiving these communications from us, please follow the instructions contained in an applicable 
					communication you receive from us.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p><strong>Events:&nbsp;</strong>Mada Properties may host events for product knowledge sharing. 
				If you register for a Mada Properties event, we will access the information in your account to provide you 
				with information and services associated with the event. If you register for one of our events and you are not a 
				Mada Properties member, we will collect your first and last name, email address, business or home address, information 
				about the type of business you work for or with, which we will use to provide you with information and services associated with the event.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Communications with Mada Properties:&nbsp;</strong>If you communicate or correspond with us by email, through postal mail, 
				via phone or through other forms of communication, including our customer service centre, we may collect the information you provide as 
				part of those communications. For example, if you correspond with us through email, we may collect and store the email address you use to 
				send the applicable correspondence and use it to respond to your enquiry; to notify you of Mada Properties events, or other services; or to 
				keep a record of your complaint, accommodation request, and similar purposes.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p><strong>b. Information we automatically collect from you</strong>&nbsp;We may automatically collect information about you when you use 
				the sites or our services. For example, if you access the sites through a computer, we will automatically collect information such as your 
				browser type and version, computer and connection information, IP address, pages you have visited and standard web log information. We may 
				use remarketing tools that will serve ads to you based on your location, the content you have explored on our site to render ads to you 
				after you have left our site. If you access the sites through a mobile device, we may also be able to identify the location of your mobile device. 
				You may choose not to share your location details with us by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings. For instructions on changing 
				the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.
				</p>
				<p>We may automatically collect information from you when you use the sites using ‘cookies’ and other similar technologies, such as web beacons. 
					Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored within your computer’s internet browser and that are accessed and recorded by the websites 
					that you visit so that they can recognise the same browser navigating online at a later time.</p>
				<p>The cookies are not able to execute code or access other information stored on the computer. Web beacons are transparent pixel 
					images that are used in collecting information about website usage, email response and tracking. In addition to those mentioned above, 
					third parties may also set cookies when you visit the site. In some cases, that is because we have hired a third party to provide services 
					on our behalf, such as an enquiry form. Because your browser connects to those third parties, they are able to set or read their own cookies 
					on your device and may collect information about your online activities (but not any personally identifiable data) across websites or online 
					services. Some of our pages use a third-party software provider, such as Optimizely, Unbounce, Hotjar etc to test variations in the content to 
					help us improve your experience. Information that may be collected by cookies when you use the sites may include, without limitation:
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ul class="px-4" style="list-style-type: disc;">
					<li>the pages you visit within the sites</li>
					<li>the date and time of your visit to the sites</li>
					<li>the amount of time you spend using the sites</li>
					<li>the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the internet</li>
					<li>your computer and connection information such as your browser type and version, operating system and platform</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>This information is collected to enhance the site performance and end user experience. You can set your browser to reject 
					cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. To learn more about your ability to manage cookies and web beacons, 
					please consult the privacy features in your browser.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing communications</strong>&nbsp;We may combine your information with data we collect from 
				our vendors and use it to improve and personalise the Mada Properties website. If you don't wish to receive marketing 
				communications from us or participate in our ad-customisation programs, simply update your communication preferences 
				at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:marketing@madaproperties.com">marketing@madaproperties.com</a>, or follow the directions provided with the communication or 
				advertisement.&nbsp;
			</p>
				<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use, sharing and retention of personal information</strong>&nbsp;<strong>a. How we use your information</strong>&nbsp;In general, 
					we use the information we collect primarily to provide, maintain, protect, and improve our current products and to develop new ones. This allows us to:

			<p><strong>b. Information for individuals located in the European Union</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Legal basis for the processing of personal 
					information from EEA residents</strong>&nbsp;If you reside within the European Economic Area (EEA), our processing of your personal 
					information will be legitimised as follows:
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ul class="px-4" style="list-style-type: disc;">
					<li>Whenever we require your consent for the processing of your personal information such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (‘GDPR’). This article in the GDPR describes when processing can be done lawfully.<br>
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>If the processing of your personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and Mada Properties or for taking any pre-contractual steps upon your request, such processing will be based on GDPR Article 6(1) lit (b). If this data is not processed, Mada Properties will not be able to execute the contract with you.<br>
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Where the processing is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation, we will process your information on basis of GDPR Article 6(1) lit (c), for example complying in the fields of employment law.<br>
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>And where the processing is necessary for the purposes of Mada Properties’s legitimate interests, such processing will be made in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1) lit (f), for example to detect fraud.<br>
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li>You may also receive personalised advertising where you indicate to Mada Properties specific interests by requesting information about a product or service or by indicating your marketing preferences in the Preference Centre (access to which is provided at the bottom of this page), however, you may also receive general communications regarding new launches, promotions or schemes.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Transferring personal data from the EU to the Saudi Arabia</strong>&nbsp;Mada Properties has its headquarters in the Saudi Arabia. 
				Information we collect from you will be processed in Saudi Arabia. The security of your privacy and the information you give us is very important 
				to us, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Mada Properties or guarantee that your information on the 
				Mada Properties Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical or 
				managerial safeguards.
				</p>
				<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as log in credentials) on our order form or chat form, we encrypt that information using secure 
					socket layer technology (SSL). Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 
					As a result, Mada Properties cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the sites and 
					you do so at your own risk. Mada Properties participates in its compliance with the EU Privacy Shield Framework.
				</p>
				<p>Mada Properties is committed to subjecting all personal information received from EU member countries to the Frameworks’ applicable principles 
					(‘Principles’).&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p><br>

					privacy laws provide certain rights for data subjects (these are persons that can be identified). This Privacy Notice is intended to 
					provide you with information about what personal data Mada Properties collects about you and how it is used. If you wish to confirm that 
					Mada Properties is processing your personal data, or to have access to the personal data Mada Properties may have about you, or have other

					through our Data Subject Access Portal about:
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<ul class="px-4" style="list-style-type: disc;">
					<li>the purpose of the processing</li>
					<li>the categories of personal data concerned</li>
					<li>who else outside Mada Properties might have received the data from Mada Properties</li>
					<li>what the source of the information was (if you did not provide it directly to Mada Properties)</li>
					<li>where the personal data is stored and how long it will be stored</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>You have a right to correct (rectify) the record of your personal data maintained by Mada Properties if it is inaccurate. 
					You may request that Mada Properties erase that data or cease processing it, subject to certain exceptions. You may also ask Mada 
					Properties for your personal data to be supplemented or updated, or for their transformation into anonymous format or to block any 
					data held in violation of the law, as well as to oppose their treatment for any and all legitimate reasons. You may withdraw your 
					consent for the processing of personal data or the further processing of personal data by Mada Properties at any time. You may also

				 necessary for the purposes for which your personal data are processed.
				</p>
				<p>We will retain your personal data as long as you are a Mada Properties customer or require our services so that we can 
					provide these services to you. If you are located in the European Economic Area, at the moment you come out of Mada Properties 
					association or withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal information, all your personal data received and stored 
					will be erased if no longer needed by us. Unless we are required to retain this personal data by law or to comply with our regulatory 
					obligations. In such a case, we will only keep this personal data for as long as necessary. For more information on where and how long your 
					personal data is stored, and for more information on your rights of erasure and portability, please contact our data privacy
